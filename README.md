# GrapRAG
This GrapRAG is a minimum viable product (MVP) jointly designed by a friend and me. It integrates graph-based document representation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve semantic understanding and contextual retrieval in unstructured texts.

## Overview

This project combines graph structures with language model-based retrieval to support more accurate and context-aware responses. By constructing lightweight semantic graphs from source documents, GrapRAG enhances the reasoning and generation capabilities of large language models.

## Key Features

Graph construction from unstructured documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, plain text)

Node- and edge-based retrieval algorithms to enhance context selection

Integration with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) for generation

Modular architecture supporting different graph engines (e.g., NetworkX, Neo4j)

Configurable chunking, embedding, and retrieval strategies

## Use Cases

Legal and regulatory document QA

Scientific literature summarization

Enterprise knowledge base assistant

Research paper semantic exploration

## Installation

‘git clone https://github.com/your-org/graprag.git

cd graprag

pip install -r requirements.txt’

Python 3.9+ is recommended.

## Getting Started
To run the full pipeline on a sample document:

python main.py --input data/sample.pdf --config config.yaml

To launch the web interface (if applicable):

streamlit run ui/app.py

## Configuration

The system can be configured via config.yaml. Example configuration parameters include:

llm_provider: openai

model_name: gpt-4

graph_type: knowledge_graph

chunk_size: 500

embedding_model: text-embedding-ada-002

retrieval_top_k: 5

## Dependencies

Python >= 3.9

LangChain

NetworkX or Neo4j

OpenAI SDK

FAISS (optional for embedding-based retrieval)
